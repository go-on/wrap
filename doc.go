Package wrap creates a fast and flexible middleware stack for http.Handlers.

Each middleware is a wrapper for another middleware and fullfills the
Wrapper interface.

Features

- small; core is only 28 LOC (with comments)
- based on http.Handler interface; integrates fine with net/http
- middleware stacks are http.Handlers too and may be embedded
- low memory footprint
- fast

Wrappers can be found at github.com/go-on/wrap-contrib/wraps.

Status

100% test coverage.
This package is considered complete, stable and ready for production.
