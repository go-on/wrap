Package wrap creates a fast and flexible middleware stack for http.Handlers.

Each middleware is a wrapper for another middleware and fullfills the
Wrapper interface.

A nice introduction into this library can be found at http://metakeule.github.io/article/wrap-go-middlware-framework.html.

Features

- small; core is only 13 LOC
- based on http.Handler interface; integrates fine with net/http
- middleware stacks are http.Handlers too and may be embedded
- low memory footprint
- fast

Wrappers can be found at github.com/go-on/wrap-contrib.

Status

100% test coverage.
This package is considered complete and the API is stable.

Benchmarks (Go 1.3):

	// The overhead of n writes to http.ResponseWriter via n wrappers
	// vs n writes in a loop within a single http.Handler
