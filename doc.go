Package wrap creates fast and flexible middleware for http.Handlers.

It has probably the most simple implementation one could think of.
Each middleware is a wrapper for another middleware and fullfills the
Wrapper interface.

This package is considered stable, feature complete and ready for production.

A lot of wrappers can be found at github.com/go-on/wrap-contrib/wraps.

Benchmarks:

	// The overhead of n writes to http.ResponseWriter via n wrappers
	// vs n writes in a loop within a single http.Handler
